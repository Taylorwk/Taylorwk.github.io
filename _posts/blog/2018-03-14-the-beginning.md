Blogs are new to me. Consider this an intellectual playground that I will need to grow accustom to over the next few posts. I hope to give a short introduction to what you can expect to see here on this blog.  I quite enjoy fields that combine philosophical aspects with scientific ones so many of the topics I cover will relate to these in some form or another.  

Expect posts about AI safety, physics and nanotechnology, biotechnology and bioethics, and perhaps my reflections on my current research. However I also enjoy a dash of policy so also don't be surprised if you see some musings on nonproliferation or how policitians should deal with specific emerging technologies. As I alluded to before, my first technical post will probably venture into AI safety and value alignment as I have started to delve into that subject more and more over the past couple of weeks.  

If you just can't wait to learn more about this interesting topic consider looking at Robert Miles' [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB7AzTwc6VFZrBsO2ucBMg/featured). He goes over a broad number of ideas within AI safety to start you out. But regardless, stay tuned as I will be having more content coming out over the next couple months!
